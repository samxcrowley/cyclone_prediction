- Over the weekend fixed Jonas' issues with the full GraphCast model, so now I can reliably use the full model

- Worked on cleaning up and organising code (into logical individual .py files and cleaned up imports etc.)

- Began using an IBTrACS dataset to learn how it works and is structured

- Chose an initial test TC (Anika 2022) and began trying to plot its track on a map of Australia
-- This involved using Cartopy for the first time, will have to continue to learn

- Successfully plotted TC Anika on a Cartopy map of Australia

- Read a bit on TC tracking algorithms (from GraphCast, ECMWF, Jonas)

- Began work on dynamically getting all needed data on a TC from IBTrACS dataset just by giving the TC's name and season

- Began work on a naive MSLP tracking algo which takes in starting lat and lon



- Check-in with Linh
-- Tasks for week 3:
--- Devise tracking algorithm IN WORDS and send to Linh for checking
---- Once all good, then put into code
--- Produce density map as in Linh's 2022 paper on observed data in Australia
---- 

-- Use weak and strong TCs as test subjects
--- Models generally predict better on stronger TCs than weak ones (weak more likely to be affected by outside influences)

-- Questions:
--- Do I need to consider data from far outside Australia? What is range of effect?
---- Just use the 3 basins, outside of those not relevant
