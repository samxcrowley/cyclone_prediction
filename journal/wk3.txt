- Over the weekend I fixed Jonas' issues with the full GraphCast model, so now I can reliably use the full model
- Worked on cleaning up and organising code (into logical individual .py files and cleaned up imports etc.)
- Began using an IBTrACS dataset to learn how it works and is structured
- Chose an initial test TC (Anika 2022) and began trying to plot its track on a map of Australia
-- This involved using Cartopy for the first time, will have to continue to learn
- Successfully plotted TC Anika on a Cartopy map of Australia
- 11am disaster meeting
