This was a project with the ANU Institute for Climate, Energy & Disaster Solutions (ICEDS) to evaluate the effectiveness of Google DeepMind's model GraphCast for the prediction and identification of Tropical Cyclones (TCs) in Australia and the surrounding regions.

Using ERA5 climate reanalysis data, the model was trained to predict known TCs with a tracking algorithm (found in `tracking.py`) applied on top. Overall, the model could fairly effectively track TC trajectories and predict their intensities for a period of up to 10 days after the start time. The model only needed to be given climate data at a given start time and data at the time 6 hours before, and it could predict up to 10 days afterwards in 6-hour steps.
