- dynamically get all data on a TC just by giving name and year
-- change to only use ID rather than name and year
-- dynamically obtain start and end times of TC from the IBTrACS dataset to feed into tracking algorithms

- figure out / fix lon and lat arrays from IBTrACS dataset being of the form [[values]] so that it is just [values]

- time_step should be global (maybe could use a time file? or can go in data_utils)

- rename / change data_utils -> utils ?

- check and fix warnings from running output

- produce track density map of observed data on Australia region

- tracking algo. in words

- Seaborn for e.g. violin plots
