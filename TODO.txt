- dynamically get all data on a TC just by giving name and year
-- change to only use ID rather than name and year
-- dynamically obtain start and end times of TC from the IBTrACS dataset to feed into tracking algorithms

- figure out / fix lon and lat arrays from IBTrACS dataset being of the form [[values]] so that it is just [values]

- rename / change data_utils -> utils ?

- check and fix warnings from running output

- produce track density map of observed data on Australia region

- timedelta vs. datetime mismatch (ideally all in datetime)
-- is pred data removing datetime field??

- Seaborn for e.g. violin plots
